# The Climate Repository Project

The Climate Repository Project aims at combining climate data from different sources in a single, accessible and organized repository. We offer three ways of accessing our data:
- Direct access via GitHub
- Dashboard access via Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15bUqv40_06nZJp3Js4b0muO8vMzJbOO_?usp=sharing
- Script access via our scripts

Stay tuned for updates!
