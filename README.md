# The Climate Repository Project

The Climate Repository Project aims at combining climate data from different sources in a single, accessible and organized repository. We offer three ways for accessing data:
- Dashboard access via Colab at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15bUqv40_06nZJp3Js4b0muO8vMzJbOO_?usp=sharing
- Script access via our scripts (retrieval.py in script folder)
- Direct access via GitHub (navigating through this repository)

Stay tuned for updates!
